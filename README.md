# Optimization Techniques

Coursework repository for the **Optimization Techniques** course —
Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTH).

---

## Overview

This repository contains MATLAB implementations and technical reports for the Optimization Techniques course at AUTH ECE. It covers classical numerical optimization methods across four assignments, ranging from single-variable search techniques to derivative-based multivariable solvers, constrained methods, and evolutionary algorithms.

---

## Technologies Used

- **MATLAB** — primary implementation environment
- **MATLAB Optimization Toolbox** — gradient-based solver utilities
- **MATLAB Global Optimization Toolbox** — Genetic Algorithm routines (`ga`)

---

## How to Run

**Prerequisites:** MATLAB R2020a or later, with the Optimization Toolbox and Global Optimization Toolbox installed.

**1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/eleanazeri/Optimization-Techniques.git
cd Optimization-Techniques
```

**2. Navigate to the folder of interest**
```bash
cd 02-Unconstrained-Minimization
```

**3. Run the script in MATLAB**

In the MATLAB Command Window:
```matlab
cd('path/to/02-Unconstrained-Minimization')
run('script_name.m')
```

Each folder is self-contained. Refer to inline comments within each `.m` file for parameter configuration and expected outputs.
